# Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Tool Used
Wireshark

## Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic and understand basic networking concepts.

## Observations

### 1. DNS Analysis
DNS packets were captured during browsing.
DNS converts domain names (example.com) into IP addresses.

### 2. TCP Three-Way Handshake
The TCP handshake was observed using SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets.
This confirms how a reliable TCP connection is established.

### 3. TCP vs UDP
TCP is connection-oriented and reliable.
UDP is connectionless and faster but does not guarantee delivery.

### 4. Plain Text vs Encrypted Traffic
HTTP traffic is visible in plain text.
HTTPS traffic is encrypted using TLS and cannot be read.

### 5. Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing network packets.
Wireshark was used to perform packet sniffing.

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding how network communication works
and how network traffic is analyzed in cybersecurity.
